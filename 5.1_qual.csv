Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),General-purpose developers and governance actors are highly responsible as they must prevent anthropomorphization and ensure regulatory safeguards.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),Companies putting AI into products are overselling their capabilities and ignoring the risks.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),AI Developer (General-purpose AI) - Primarily responsible - Must embed safeguards transparency and guardrails into design.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),In this case developers are highly responsible because they may refine models to drive more engagement or to make relationships more convincing which may exacerbate vulnerability.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),primary responsibility lies with AI vendors who profit from overreliance on their systems.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),Primary responsibility lies with developers deployers and infrastructure providers as they design and control the conditions under which overreliance occurs.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),No single actor can address this alone and it requires coordinated effort across the ecosystem. Those with the greatest technical capability and control should bear more responsibility as end users often can't assess AI limitations placing a higher burden on developers/deployers.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),The AI developer is primarily responsible for designing new types of guardrails to prevent overreliance. For example LLMs should incorporate more interactive UI and UX features that encourage users to engage critically with outputs. Without such measures critical thinking as we know it risks becoming obsolete.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),While responsibility falls on governance actors to address these risks the capability to do so remains with the developers making them most responsible.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),Primary responsibility should be in the hands of the AI developer in order to not have rogue AIs plundering our societies,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (Specialized AI),deployers and specialized AI developers bear primary responsibility as they control the design and application of systems in critical domains.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer (Specialized AI),Primarily responsible: Specialized AI developers are building high-stakes systems (e.g. health education companionship) and must anticipate emotional dependency.,Responsibility,Higher,,

Actor,AI Deployer,Primary responsibility lies with developers deployers and infrastructure providers as they design and control the conditions under which overreliance occurs.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI User,When engaging with AI Systems end users enter into a social contract with the system that they should use it for its intended purpose. Creating unsafe situations-- like the end-user opting to use ChatGPT for mental health therapy despite it not being a specialized system that should be used for therapy is wholly reflective of the user's decision making.,Responsibility ,Higher,,
Actor,AI Deployer,Asking developers to mitigate every use case through design implementation and monitoring activities puts an undue burden on the developer; however it should be on the developer to monitor interactions and create a blacklist of unacceptable use cases and prohibit the AI system from doing those activities and appropriately educating the end user on the nature use and limitations of the AI system.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,AI Governance Actor - Highly responsible - Establish standards and enforcement to prevent systemic overreliance.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Developer,I must say that for the excessive reliance on AI the management and regulatory departments of organizations that apply AI technology have the greatest responsibility.

Actor,AI Governance Actor,Highly responsible: Affected stakeholders have ethical duties when deploying AI in vulnerable settings. Governance actors and domain-specific developers shape trust boundaries.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,We will never be able to align the corporate incentives for reducing overreliance. Governance actors must step in and be primarily responsible for mitigating overreliance.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,Primarily a governance failure to prohibit sensitive applications of AI without appropriate testing,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,AI governance actors have a key role in increasing public awareness on the risks of overreliance and appropriate behaviours for users to mitigate it.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,AI governance actors also have a high responsibility in sufficiently informing these AI users on what types of decisions shouldn't be delegated.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,User education governance and guardrails and deployment strategy are essential to ensure sustained knowledge is not lost forever,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI User,Users are moderately responsible since awareness and critical use are important though their systemic power is limited.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI User,AI User - Moderately responsible - Users should exercise judgment but their control is limited.,Responsibility,"Higher, Lower",,
Actor,AI User,Moderately responsible: Users and infrastructure providers contribute to system-level reliance but are often reacting to upstream decisions.,Responsibility,"Higher, Lower",,
Actor,AI User,Users cannot be seen to be fully responsible if developers are driving models to be more engaging and if the user is not properly informed of these risks but ultimately a user should be partially responsible for overuse.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI User,Users and affected stakeholders are the most vulnerable but have limited agency to mitigate risks themselves so their responsibility is minimal.,Responsibility,Lower,,
Actor,AI User,While users arent completely reasonable for the use cases of AI they do have moral obligations on their own ends to decide whether to use AI for good or bad.,Responsibility,Higher,,
Actor,AI User,Humans delegating key decisions is primarily the fault of these humans hence primarily responsible for AI users.,Responsibility,Higher,,

Actor,Affected Stakeholder,Users and affected stakeholders are the most vulnerable but have limited agency to mitigate risks themselves so their responsibility is minimal.,Vulnerability,Higher,,
Actor,Educational Institutions,Additionally educational and training institutions must be recognized as responsible actors since they provide the knowledge and cultural frameworks needed to avoid unsafe overreliance on AI.,Responsibility,Higher,,exclude - not assessing responsibility for sectors
Actor,Industry Bodies,I believe that industry bodies should be highly responsible for this risk as self-regulation is the most common approach in many jurisdictions and industry bodies are empowered to establish industry standards that minimise common harms to each sector.,Responsibility,Higher,,"suggesting actor not included in set, remove"
Sector,All Sectors,With my vulnerability assessments I do not believe there is currently any sector that isnt extremely vulnerable to the risks associated with AI - based on my experiences in studying AI risk in defence transport higher education healthcare. social work etc. I have yet to see any sociotechnical system that has an appropriate set of controls in place to manage AI risks.,Vulnerability,Higher,,

Sector,Commentary ,I would caveat my answers by saying these areas are all vulnerable if they over-adopt. If a high vulnerability area does not adopt AI extensively then the risks decline but each industry chosen as extremely vulnerable to overreliance or misplaced trust is likely to have market or other pressures to adopt and so they will face this vulnerability.,Vulnerability,Higher,,
Sector,All Sectors,Similar to before: perverse incentives exist for AI vendors to promote anthropomorphising AI systems and overreliance on the same. There's no real difference between industry sectors - it applies equally to the technology overall.,Vulnerability,Higher,,

Sector,Utilities,Ratings reflect consequences of over-trust: life- and safety-critical or tightly networked systems (healthcare national security transport/energy utilities and algorithmic finance/IT decisioning) are higher,Vulnerability,Higher,,
Sector,High-stress Sectors,The outcomes of the decisions made by AI models in health care financial services have the highest sensitivity and exposure given that those AI outcomes create long-term impacts for the end-user/recipient of those AI decisions-- i.e. being erroneously denied by an AI system for healthcare coverage or for a mortgage.,Vulnerability,Higher,,
Sector,Commentary ,The sectors I rated as highly/extremely vulnerable share a common characteristic: heavy reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) by employees and stakeholders. The fundamental challenge with LLMs is their mostly correct problem - they generate plausible coherent responses that are accurate most of the time making it extremely difficult to identify when they produce errors hallucinations or biased outputs.,Commentary,,,
Sector,Commentary ,There may be some bad actors present in the minimally vulenerable sections but highly vulnerable industries might have really bad issues with bad use cases of AI,Commentary,,,
General,Commentary,Depth of sophistication and complexity and technical know-how drives vulnerability repeatability reduces vulnerability as downside is low and upside is high. Learning curve for the trade is inversely proportional to vulnerability,Commentary,,,
General,Commentary,I often think of the anecdote -- the creator of the first pencil did not intend it to be used as a violent weapon that could potentially be used to stab people; regulating the pencil making industry and labeling it as an arms manufacturer would cause harm to 100% of all pencil producers only to benefit the 0.05% of pencil victims.,Commentary,,,
General,Commentary,When AI algorithms are specifically designed to be addictive (see the social dilemma) why would we even measure how dangerous they are when they are specifically designed by tech companies to be addictive and dangerous. It's akin to conducting a risk assessment on smoking in light of the mountains of evidence on how bad it is for your health.,Commentary,,,
General,AI User,I would also distinguish between casual users who might be unwittingly drawn in to engage with a model versus expert or professional users over-relying on a model to do work. The former would be less responsible for over-reliance or over-trusting a model as they might be steered to do so without knowing while a professional user should do their due diligence before using such models in their own work.,"Commentary, Responsibility",,,
General,Commentary,Cases of groups being vulnerable in the section of human agency is already rampant in society. I mean look at the issues arising from a single massive AI update. People were complaining about losing GPT-4o as a companion when the shift to GPT-5 was a thing,Commentary,,,
General,Commentary,All high vulnerability areas are areas where adoption is possible and likely and where overuse could lead to loss of agency of individuals or organizations. Even developers are vulnerable because they are likely to deploy autonomous agents to help with development and monitoring processes within their company and may develop dependencies and also erode their decision making capabilities.,Commentary,,,
General,Commentary,Too many responsible parties (or tangentially responsible parties) to count,Commentary,,,
