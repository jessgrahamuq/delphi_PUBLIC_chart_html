Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),"AI Developers (General-purpose): These actors are at the core of AI creation. Their decisions on architecture, training data, and capabilities directly influence whether an AI could be considered sentient or autonomous. Therefore, they bear primary responsibility.",Responsibility,Higher,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),"I do not consider this to be a very short-term risk, but it does require some attention -- in the same way that geneticists have a taboo on human cloning, AI developers should develop a taboo on creating AI systems with certain structures that would conceivably make them moral patients.",Responsibility,Higher,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,"AI Governance Actors: Without clear governance, ethical treatment of AI cannot be standardized. These actors must lead in defining rights and protections, especially as AI systems become more complex.",Responsibility,Higher,
Actor,AI User,"AI Users: While they don't create or deploy AI, their behavior toward AI systems can reinforce ethical or unethical norms. Their responsibility is moderate.",Responsibility,Lower,
Actor,AI User,"If users treat AIs badly, this could influence their welfare.",Responsibility,Higher,
Actor,AI Infrastructure Provider,"Infrastructure Providers: Their role is more technical and less ethical, hence minimal responsibility.",Responsibility,Lower,
Actor,Affected Stakeholder,"Affected Stakeholders: These individuals or groups are recipients of AI's impact, not its creators or deployers, so they should not be held responsible",Responsibility,Lower,
Actor,Affected Stakeholder,"Affected Stakeholders are now correctly marked as highly vulnerable, as they are often the most impacted by AI decisions without having any control or understanding.",Vulnerability,Higher,EXCLUDE - not related to the risk
Actor,All Actors,every actor that develops or in some way interacts with an AI system capable of feeling harm should be morally responsible towards the system.,General Responsibility Comment,General Responsibility Comment,
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),"AI welfare can be influenced at many stages of the AI production process. In the first instance, labs will be controlling the conditions under which AIs exist.",Responsibility,Higher,
Sector,Scientific R&D and Health Care,Scientific R&D and Health Care remain the most vulnerable sectors due to their proximity to advanced AI and direct human impact.,Vulnerability,Higher,EXCLUDE - not related to the risk
General,Commentary,"AI is not sentient at all, this is a non existent issue, pseudoscience",,,EXCLUDE
Actor ,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),The burden of responsibility must follow both proximity to power and potential to prevent harm. Developers and governance actors shape the terrain; deployers choose the path; and users walk it. But custodial actors build the map - often invisibly.,Responsibility ,Higher,

General,Commentary,Vulnerability to actors other than AI systems themselves is based on likelihood of moral backlash or feelings of guilt if actor gets if wrong and creates and mistreats an AI systems that some feel would be a moral patient.,General Vulnerability Comment,,
General,Commentary,"Humans are vulnerable only insofar as the situation causes them to feel discomfort with violating AI welfare. The various societal sectors are vulnerable to the extent that they made made up of AIs whose welfare and rights are violated, which is likely not at all the case today but could change radically in the future.",General Vulnerability Comment,,
General,Commentary,"I don't think there are any clear differences between ecosystem actors and sectors. AI welfare concerns could lead to significant disruption if it leads to major changes in the kinds of systems that are used or the way that they are used, but I don't think the way in which the impact of this will vary across groups is predictable at this point.",General Vulnerability Comment,,
General,Commentary,"This part of the survey isn't working correctly, because AI welfare in the first instance affects AIs, not humans. So these questions will tend to get very low scores, which will suggest that AI welfare isn't a significant issue. But the scores will be irrelevant.",,,EXCLUDE - methodological critique
General,Commentary,I don't see how anyone would be vulnerable to risks if an AI is harmed. The point of AI welfare is to give AI rights irrespective of how it impacts humans. Analogous to animal rights.,General Vulnerability Comment,,
General,Commentary,This question makes no sense,,,EXCLUDE
General,Commentary,"This still makes no sense from my ethical perspective, answers would be inaccurate, exclude me from this section I think",,,EXCLUDE
