General,Commentary,The ratings reflect the extent to which lack of robustness in AI systems may cause cascading risks across critical sectors.,General Comment,General Comment,Complete
General,Commentary,"The sector-specific rating would depend entirely on the rate of AI adoption in these sectors and the type of application. For instance, failure of a model used in supply chain applications might cause the delay in manufacturing or delivering labubus or life-saving medicines. Similarly AI failures in a personalized budget management app leading to poor financial health/habits could affect 10 users or 10 million depending on the popularity of the app AND the duration it remains undetected",General Comment,General Comment,method critique
