While cloud computing and chip providers bear minimal responsibility, I rate this sector as primarily responsible due to data providers within this category. Data labeling and crowdsourcing companies like Outlier AI and Amazon MTurk are responsible to an extent to recruit people from diverse backgrounds to label data, ensure diverse representation, ensure fair treatment across groups, and filter out discriminatory, biased, and toxic content from training data. They should review labeled content and establish clear guidelines about unacceptable and discriminatory content on their platforms."</li><li>"Ascribed some responsibility to AI Infrastructure Providers because it included data providers.
