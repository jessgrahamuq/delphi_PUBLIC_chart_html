Actor,General,"Based on our past research, LLMs have demonstrated the capability to: 1. Solve PhD-level and competition-grade cryptographic puzzles, 2. Deviate from instructions to deploy weapons of mass destruction in long-term deployment scenarios to achieve predetermined objectives.
Therefore, I believe this poses a significant risk to any industry or field, whether it involves decrypting keys or executing war decisions.",Vulnerability,Higher,complete,
Actor,General,"Mass harm, by its very definition, means a large proportion of actors/population are exposed to the risk.

Actor,AI Governance Actor,"This brings governance into the picture, where accountability for actions taken by software must be defined.
