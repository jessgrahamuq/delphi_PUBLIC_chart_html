Actor,AI User,While an immediate thought initially jumps to those individuals managing the build of and allocation of resources in compute centers users also have an obligation to interact with AI systems in a way that is thoughtful and that does not consume excessive resources-- e.g. why are individuals using ChatGPT like a google search?,Responsibility,Higher,
Actor,AI Governance Actor,Governance actors have high responsibility in setting sustainability standards and incentivizing greener practices.,Responsibility,Higher,
Actor,AI User,Users hold only moderate responsibility as their choices (e.g. preference for sustainable AI services) can exert market pressure but do not directly control systemic environmental impacts.,Responsibility,Lower,
Actor,AI User,For AI user the responsibility depends on whether the user has alternatives to the AI solution.,General Responsibility Comment ,General Responsibility Comment ,
Sector,All Sectors,As the definition of environmental harm includes energy consumption associated with the development and use of AI I have rated all sectors as extremely vulnerable - if the definition was tweaked a little the ratings could be more nuanced to reflect only the sectors that can do direct environmental harm with the AI e.g. mining transport,General Vulnerability Comment,General Vulnerability Comment,
Sector,All Sectors,Environmental harm caused by one entity/sector/group effects all of society.,General Vulnerability Comment,General Vulnerability Comment,
Sector,All Sectors,As AI has an impact on climate change everyone is a least minimally vulnerable to AI environmental harms.,General Vulnerability Comment,General Vulnerability Comment,
Sector,All Sectors,How do you measure the value of a public good? Environmental effects are very broad -- climate health etc. Sectors may be affected depending on intensity of AI use or dependence on external environmental conditions but the effects don't really discriminate.,General Vulnerability Comment,General Vulnerability Comment,method critique 
Sector,All Sectors,What I mean here is the effects of a possible future AI takover which is likely to lead to complete environmental devastation killing everyone. When it comes to the more dominant present-day discourse about the use of present-day LLMs and their carbon footprint etc there is less reason for concern. If that is what you have in mind change extremely vulnerable to minimally vulnerable throughout.,General Vulnerability Comment,General Vulnerability Comment,
