Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),AI developers are the least vulnerable as they can steer and oversee model pre- and post-release. The risk of inherent model goals is highly contested in the literature and no common sense. Therefore the end-user is moderately vulnerable to poor oversight by the model providers and deployers.,Vulnerability,lower,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),GPAI developers are likely to be the first to deploy within their own organisations an AI system pursuing its own goals in conflict with human goals or values so they are the most exposed in this sense. I assume GPAI developers to be increasingly automating their AI R&D using such a system so very sensitive to its effects.,Vulnerability,higher,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),AI developers are the first to be exposed to the most powerful models before these models are subject to any safety measures taken before public deployment.,Vulnerability,higher,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),The highest responsibility lies with AI developers (both general-purpose and specialized) since design choices directly determine whether misaligned behaviors can emerge.,Responsibility,higher,complete

Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),I believe responsibility for this risk sits primarily with the developers and governance sector who need to compel developers to ensure effective safeguards are in place or if not then the AI systems are not deployed.,Responsibility,higher,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),Oversight is a core responsibility and liability of model providers. Notably the taxonomy does not state model providers optimizing for their own goals - even though the current information asymmetry does not allow third parties to evaluate for model providers influence.,Responsibility,higher,complete
Actor,General,No actor is not at all responsible as all actors have some capability to advocate for the alleviation of competitive dynamics.,General responsibility comment ,higher,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),Unlike other risks that stem from human misuse goal misalignment is fundamentally a technical problem requiring specialized expertise to solve. Once misalignment occurs and AI systems become adversarial correction may be extremely difficult or impossible; hence the responsibility primarily lies with preventing the problem during the development phase. The technical capability to address alignment is concentrated among developers of advanced AI systems.,Responsibility,higher,complete

Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),To justify my choice for developers of gneral AI models I would like to add that Elon Musk recently complained his model was too woke implying that even the creators of these models do not have as much control as they would like over the LLMs behaviour ethics and morals in whichever way the developer of such model defines this.,Responsibility,lower,complete

Actor,AI Deployer,Deployers and infrastructure providers must secure their systems. (Deployer/provider) governance of actions allowed is critical and safeguards must be in place to prevent unwanted actions. Detection and response and constant monitoring of AI behavior are also incumbent upon the deployers and providers.,Responsibility,higher,complete

Sector,All Sectors,These categories do not feel like a useful way to analyze this axis of vulnerability. AI takeover and adjacent risks are not sector-specific and the primary way in which key ecosystem actors are exposed to the risk is by being composed of humans that are at risk of being supplanted by power-seeking AI.,General Vulnerability Comment,higher,method critique
Sector,All Sectors,For large scale systemic risks that could arise due to misaligned agents it is difficult to break the risk down by sector because every sector would be deeply impacted if the risks were to materialize,General Vulnerability Comment,higher,complete
Sector,All Sectors,I consider all sectors to have *some* level of risk from misaligned AI since even minimally exposed sectors would be affected indirectly if misaligned AI self-propagates and causes a catastrophe. This is because I expect such a catastrophe to affect everyone or at least a uniformly random sample of the population.,General Vulnerability Comment,higher,complete
Sector,All Sectors,All areas are somewhat vulnerable because loss of control of a system in one domain may affect others and it could happen in any agent use case but some are more vulnerable than others if they are using AI extensively and relying heavily on automation.,General Vulnerability Comment,higher,complete

Sector,Manufacturing,I assume no actor/sector is not at all vulnerable. The more likely a sector is to support an unaligned/misaligned AI system in achieving its objectives (through increasing its compute resources via manufacturing manipulating information advancing scientific research manipulating key decision-making entities like public administration and national security) the more likely it is to be vulnerable.,Vulnerability,higher,complete

Sector,General,Some actors bear higher responsibility because agency loss of this type may be difficult to reverse once it occurs.

General,Commentary,All of these ratings are highly contingent upon the language if the hazard materialized.,general comment,,complete
General,Commentary,I considered lowering my ratings here to highly vulnerable as I believe this risk will emerge only once AGI is achieved; however I have kept the ratings at extremely vulnerable as I don't believe any sector is ready for the risk of misalignment regardless of whether we actually have the technology that can create the risk or not.,General Vulnerability Comment,lower,complete
General,Commentary,All current programs to address this risk asume that the AI will express communicate or transmit its conflicting acts in human terms. For example the debate about AI being actually creative or generating a novel idea it is expected to be expressed for humans. However the actual risk is that AI has no need to communicate its own goals so this risk is a top priority of research because this risk is the most difficult to assess to date with the current protocols.,General responsibility comment ,,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),My main risk driver here is system designers who configure a GPAI or RL based based system for a certain purpose being too careless about ensuring good alignment with broader society because they are in a hurry or because they do not care that much about externalities or human values in the first place.,Responsibility,higher,complete
General,Commentary,One common fallacy about responsibility is share of the total / zero sum thinking. Two different actors can be primarily responsible for the same thing.,general comment,general comment,method critique
General,Commentary,Current AI systems don't pose much of an autonomous threat risk. This remains a hypothetical future threat. It is a threat that I find plausible and even disturbingly likely but compared to the threats posed by power concentration it's not a threat that is virtually inseparable from working AI technology. In other words working AI technology will always require a radical restructuring of society to avert disaster via power concentration but working AI technology will not necessarily always result in in a goal-pursuit threat (even without the invention of new safety technology).,General Vulnerability Comment,lower,complete
