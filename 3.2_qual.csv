Sector,"Agriculture, Mining, Construction and Manufacturing","[1] Agriculture - extremely vulnerable I rated agriculture as extreme vulnerable due to existing AI models being highly biased in misrepresenting livestock farming reality. Current AI systems consistently depict idealistic pastoral scenes (cows grazing on pastures, pigs in mud) rather than the reality of indoor, intensive farming systems. This creates a dangerous loss of consensus reality about how we actually produce food and treat farm animals.

The problem is compounded because: (a) the general public already has limited knowledge about food production systems, (b) people need farmers ""three times a day"" through food consumption but pay little attention to farming practices, and (c) when future AI systems train on biased outputs from current AI, these misrepresentations become further reinforced.",Vulnerability,Higher,complete,This comment seems misleading - they're thinking about animal vulnerability as an actor group inside the sector 'agriculture'

Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),"[1] AI Developer (general-purpose) - primarily responsible: I rated general-purpose AI developers as primarily responsible because they have ultimate control over model behavior and design.
