Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),AI developer was rated as primarily responsible because they are often the only ones in the pipeline that have the actual capability to make AI decisions transparent and interpretable,responsibility,higher,complete
Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),[1] AI Developers - Primarily Responsible: I rated AI developers as primarily responsible because they are the actors who implement the prompt revision processes and design the system prompts that govern model behavior. They have direct control over these mechanisms and therefore bear the primary responsibility for being transparent about what system prompts they use and how their prompt revision processes function.,responsibility,higher,complete

Actor,AI Developer (General-purpose AI),"Lower rates are given to either actors who do not have access to the technology to be able to practically address the risk or are enablers. Higher rates are given to actors who have responsibility in the design, development, and deployment of the AI systems and hence have the means to mitigate the lack of transparency and interpretability risk.",responsibility,higher,complete

Actor,AI Governance Actor,Governance actors must ensure strict controls and testing around that.,responsibility,higher,complete
Actor,AI Governance Actor,"[3] AI Governance Actors - Primarily Responsible: I rated governance actors as primarily responsible because they possess the greatest power to address this issue through policy, regulation and law. They can push forward laws and policies that require companies to be transparent about their system prompts and prompt revision processes. Additionally, they can mandate that companies provide access to base model behavior without prompt revision at least in the model evaluation process, ensuring that evaluators and researchers can assess true model capabilities. Governance actors ultimately hold the most significant power in ensuring transparency and interpretability across the AI ecosystem.",responsibility,higher,complete
Actor,AI Governance Actor,"[2] AI Governance Actors - Extremely Vulnerable: AI governance actors face extreme vulnerability because many AI researchers and evaluators are unaware that prompts are being revised and do not know what system prompts govern the revision process or what system prompts AI companies use generally. This transparency gap raises questions about model evaluation: Are we assessing model behavior after prompt revision or before? Without reliable methods to disable revision processes and evaluate base model behavior, governance and evaluation become compromised. Evaluators may assess a model as reliable, but the automatic revision process could introduce unknown bias. They cannot predict how the model will behave if users circumvent the revision system, creating significant governance vulnerabilities.",vulnerability,higher,complete

Actor,AI User,Users often lack insights that could be gained from manufacturers making their algorithms clear and predictable.,responsibility,lower,complete
Actor,AI User,"AI users face extreme vulnerability due to lack of transparency in system prompts, which control what AI systems can and cannot say or do. Most companies, except Anthropic, do not disclose their system prompts, creating opportunities for encoded bias, discrimination, and unintended consequences. The automatic prompt revision process is a perfect example of the consequences of lack of transparency. Research has shown that users cannot control OpenAI's prompt revision process in their text-to-image models. When users submit prompts, they are not even aware that their prompts are being revised, OpenAI does not voluntarily provide the revised prompt as output on their web interface, and users cannot disable this process even when aware of it. This lack of transparency can distort reality on controversial topics. For example, when users request images of dairy or pig farms, the system consistently shows pastoral scenes rather than realistic depictions of intensive farming, reinforcing existing misconceptions. Only through specialized prompt engineering techniques can researchers bypass this process to reveal that the base model is actually aware of intensive farming realities. The prompt revision process erased that reality, and showed all cows on pasture and pigs in mud. There is no transparency in the system prompt used to govern the prompt revision process.",vulnerability,higher,complete

Sector,"Public Admin, Nat Sec, Information, Science, Finance, Education","Public admin, Nat Sec, Information, Science, finance etc are highly vulnerable because they involve significant requirements or expectations to be able to show provenance of ideas and decision making processes in order to justify high-impact decisions. Areas like education are highly vulnerable partly due to a need to justify decisions and be transparent about AI use, but more so because lack of transparency might lead to harms that affect individuals' education and long term outcomes which are even more high risk and long-term than a mistake in another sector.",vulnerability,higher,complete

Sector,"Information, Education, Culture, Scientific Research, Arts","Deep learning models are often biased because of the data they are trained on is also biased. The lack of interpretability makes it difficult to identify biased responses/decisions. This is especially risky for information, education, and culture (but also for scientific research). LLMs in particular tend to lie pretty consistently about their responses being biased and lack of interpretabilty jeopardizes trust. Imagine AI reading CVs, loan applications, and making biased decisions but lying about it when asked. via prompt. Arts is also vulnerable because without interpretability, it's difficult to perform 'data attribution', i.e., understanding what human art the model used to produce generated art and attributing the original authors.",vulnerability,higher,complete
Sector,"Information, Science, National Security","Generally, my ratings for interpretability are based off of level of complexity. For smaller less capable models doing less complex tasks, lack of interpretability is less dangerous.
